						<h2>Software Engineering/Tech Analyst Intern | JP Morgan Chase</h2>
						<h3><span><img src = "images/placeholder.png" class = "location"/></span> Chicago, IL</h3>
						<p> This summer, I learned about the full agile development cycle and enterprise applications. At the beginning of my internship, I, along with 6 other interns, was given a problem statement, and over the course of the summer, I got to design and architect a data-driven solution stack, setup, and deployment methodology. I also refactored a monolithic application into loosely coupled microservices that could be easily maintained and deployed. My experiences at JPMC taught me the benefits of microservices and how to design for scalability and future maintenance, while showing me how to methodically deal with challenges that arise.</p>

						<h2>Co-Founder | Theia Vision</h2>
						<h3><span><img src = "images/placeholder.png" class = "location"/></span> Urbana-Champaign, IL</h3>
						<p>We are Theia Vision, a group that came together at 54.io: a startup competition at UIUC. We 're working on creating an app that does real-time object detection to give the visually impaired user information about his or her surroundings. Gone are the clunky headsets and devices; our app will connect wirelessly to a pair of smart glasses to take in surroundings and act as a personal assistant to the user. I'm a member of the software development team, so I'm working with convolutional neural networks for object detection.</p>

						<h2>iDCL Software Engineering Intern | Capital One</h2>
						<h3><span><img src = "images/placeholder.png" class= "location"/></span> Urbana-Champaign, IL</h3>
						<p>As a Spring semester intern, I worked on a cloud-based statement content and validation platform called Mercury. My main duties involve working with a team in the Chicago branch to develop the rule approval workflow using Angular and enhance the client experience.</p>

						<h2>Undergraduate Research Assistant | University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</h2>
						<h3><span><img src = "images/placeholder.png" class = "location"/></span> Urbana-Champaign, IL</h3>
						<p>As a part of the Promoting Undergraduate Research in Engineering(PURE) Program, I researched under <a href = "http://aastorg2.web.engr.illinois.edu/" >Angello Astorga</a>, a PhD candidate at UIUC. My work focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of automated pre-condition inference tools in terms of a white box vs black box approach.

						<h2>TARGET Intern in Scientific Computing | Fermilab</h2>
						<h3><span><img src = "images/placeholder.png" class = "location"/></span> Batavia, IL</h3>
						<p>In the beginning of the summer, I inventoried computing rooms, unified and updated documentation, and made sure all systems were labeled and up to date in the central database. Through this, I gained familiarity with Linux and bash scripting while improving my HTML skills. I also assisted with hardware moves, gaining computer hardware manipulation skills. My main task for the summer was leading a team to create a new cluster monitoring page for High-Performance Computing that would auto-update with project information every minute. Through this, I gained mastery over HTML, CSS, and Javascript for web development, as well as strengthening my Python and bash skills for the backend.</p>

						<h2>Operations Support Intern | Automatic Building Controls, LLC</h2>
						<h3><span><img src = "images/placeholder.png" class = "location"/></span> Algonquin, IL</h3>
						<p>Automatic Building Controls, LLC was my first internship experience. Here, I supported the operation team in the successful execution of Energy Management System projects, worked closely with the Operation Manager and Project Engineers to support the successful development and implementation of project schedules, updated and maintained project schedules, tracked and reported labor, material, and project costs and monitored project progress, and provided support and assisted in research for new engineering products as needed.</p>
