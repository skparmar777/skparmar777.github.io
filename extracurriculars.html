						<h2>Committee Chair & Data/Information Subcommittee Leader| Society of Women Engineers Team Tech</h2>
						<h3><span><img src = "images/placeholder.png" class = "location"/></span> Urbana-Champaign, IL (Neuqua Valley High School)</h3>
						<p>As the Engineering Open House (EOH) chair for Team Tech, I organized Team Tech's entry for Engineering Open House in Spring 2018 and held members accountable for finishing tasks. I am also working on creating an engineering solution for Caterpillar, Inc.
							As the Data/Information Subcommittee leader, I lead a smaller team of 6 members to research how to send, receive, and optimize data for CAT's engineering solution.</p>

						<p>ChicTech is an annual event sponsored by Women in Computer Science (WCS) UIUC that aims to promote interest for women in Computer Science.

						<h2>President and Founder | Tutoring Club</h2>
						<h3><span><img src = "images/placeholder.png" class = "location"/></span> Naperville, IL (Neuqua Valley High School)</h3>
						<p>As a member of a school of 4000, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. That's why I started Tutoring Club at Neuqua Valley High School as a freshman. Over my four years here, I organized and managed all club activities and schedules, recruited qualified tutors, created and maintained the club website, wrote lessons and activities for the various subjects as shown on the website, and worked with the local Middle Schoolsâ€™ Neuqua Valley- bound students to ensure a smooth transition into high school.</p>

						<h2>Junior Board Member | KidsMatter</h2>
						<h3><span><img src = "images/placeholder.png" class = "location"/></span> Naperville, IL </h3>
						<p>KidsMatter is a non-profit organization devoted to empowering children. As a member of the Junior Board, my main project was working with NVHS to implement the current programs for reducing student stress and anxiety. In addition, I planned and worked at KidsMatter events and attended bi-monthly board meetings to discuss and create a successful anti-stress program for students.</p>

						<h2>Teaching Assistant | Dr. Rubin's Mini Medical School</h2>
						<h3><span><img src = "images/placeholder.png" class = "location"/></span> Naperville, IL </h3>
						<p>Each year a select group of graduates from the Mini Medical School for High School Students Program are selected and volunteer to be teaching assistants. These highly motivated students are mentored by Dr. Rubin and help run the programs. After my time as a student, I was selected to be a TA, where I taught small groups of students specific skills related to the field of medicine depending on the focus of the week.</p>
